# Thinking and Planning for Project 1

## Considerations
- Who are my patrons?
- How do they interact with the restaurant?
- What kind of experience do I want them to have?

## Theme Requirements
- Adapted for humans, steampunk bulldogs, and other anthropomorphic animals (humanoid)
- Could be in person or online-only (auto kitchens, drone deliveries, etc.)
- Make the idea make sense within this world

## Technical Requirements
- HTML + CSS only (no Bootstrap or Javascript)
- External stylesheet only: `styles.css`
- No `<br>` allowed (use CSS margins/padding)
- Must include:
  - Navbar on all pages, linking to all other pages (links only)
  - Menu page
    - Need Table
  - Reservations page
    - Need form
  - Images:
    - (1) logo image
    - (3) content images

### Home Page (index.html)
- Navbar:
  - Home
  - Menu
  - Reservations
- Logo Image
- "Hero" Section
  - **h1** restaurant name
  - short tagline
  - one content image (Image #1) with alt text
- Brand, theme, and layout should be consistent across all pages
